# Snake-Game
A game using Python

# subheading
It's a game where we've made a snake using a few connected blocks and it moves upward, downward, left and right.
There will be food for the snake. Food will be a dot in a random place on the screen.
If the snake eats the food, the size of the snake will increase by 1 block.
If the snake collides with it's tail, the game will be end.
At the end the final score will be displayed.
The final score will be calculated based on how many dots that snake ate.
